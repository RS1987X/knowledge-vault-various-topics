  title: "Derivation & Solution Technique Atlas (Cross-Domain Engineering)"
  version: "2026-02-16"
  companion_to: "axioms/engineering-axiom-atlas.yaml"
  purpose: >
    Map the recurring techniques used to derive and compute solutions in engineering,
    across domains, and make explicit the later-stage assumptions each technique needs.
    This complements the Axiom Atlas by focusing on how we transform, approximate,
    and solve problems after selecting a governing model/canonical form.

intuition:
  why_this_exists: >
    The Axiom Atlas groups problems by foundational assumptions about the world/model
    (linearity, convexity, conservation, Gaussian noise, etc.). In practice, success or failure
    often hinges on later-stage choices: representation (time vs frequency), discretization (FEM/FVM),
    solver strategy (Newton vs fixed-point), and stability/conditioning/identifiability.
    This atlas makes those choices explicit and portable across fields.
  how_to_use:
    - "Start from your problem’s canonical form (or the closest family in the Axiom Atlas)."
    - "Pick a technique cluster: transforms, approximations, optimization, sensitivity, numerics, UQ."
    - "Check requires_assumptions and failure_modes before committing."
    - "Use diagnostics to detect when the assumptions are violated."
  relationship_to_axioms: >
    Axioms tell you 'what class of model is justified'; techniques tell you
    'what manipulations and solvers are valid and efficient' given additional assumptions.

assumptions_glossary:
  differentiability: "Derivatives exist and are meaningful; enables Newton/adjoints/linearization."
  smoothness: "Quantities vary without discontinuities; gradients represent local behavior."
  time_invariance: "Dynamics/response do not change with time shift; enables convolution transforms."
  stationarity: "Statistics invariant over time; supports many frequency/statistical tools."
  scale_separation: "Clear small/large parameter or fast/slow timescales exist."
  low_rank_structure: "A few modes dominate (eigenvectors/POD); enables reduced-order models."
  convexity: "No spurious local minima; duality and global convergence are reliable."
  separability: "Objective/constraints decompose by subsystem/time/commodity."
  contractivity: "Iterative map shrinks error; fixed-point iterations converge."
  well_posedness: "Solution exists, is unique, and depends continuously on inputs."
  conditioning: "Numerical sensitivity is manageable; matrices/operators not near-singular."
  identifiability: "Parameters/states can be inferred uniquely enough from data/inputs."
  bounded_uncertainty_set: "Uncertainty describable by credible bounds rather than probabilities."
  stochastic_model_credibility: "Probability model (noise/priors) is credible for UQ/inference."
  non_smooth_events: "Contacts/switches/discontinuities exist; smooth calculus may fail."
  stiffness: "Multiple timescales make explicit time stepping unstable/inefficient."
