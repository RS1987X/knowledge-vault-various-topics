A great discovery solves a great problem but there is a
grain of discovery in the solution of any problem. Your

you solve it by your own means, you may experience the
tension and enjoy the triumph of discovery. Such experi-

The author remembers the time when he was a student
himself, a somewhat ambitious student, eager to under-
stand a little mathematics and physics. He listened to
lectures, read books, tried to take in the solutions and
facts presented, but there was a question that disturbed

UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM

What its the unknown? What are the data? What 1s the condition?

Is it possible to satisfy the condition? Is the condition sufficient to
determine the unknown? Or is it insufficient? Or redundant? Or

Could you think of other data appropriate to determine the unknown?
Could you change the unknown or the data, or both if necessary, so
that the new unknown and the new data are nearer to each other?

But it was some time before I read the book again, and

~ when I did, [suddenly realized that it was even more valuable
than I’d thought! Many of Polya’s remarks that hadn't
helped me as a student now made me a better teacher of

those whose problems had differed from mine. Polya had
________met_many_more_ students than I had, and had obviously
thought very hard about how to best help all of them learn
mathematics. Perhaps his most important point 1s that learn-

ing must be active. As he said in a lecture on teaching,
“Mathematics, you see, is not a spectator sport. To under-

stand mathematics means to be able to do mathematics. And

hat does i ito be}. do’ ; os? In the F

two or more ways, it goes without saying that some students

wood gives two amusing examples of assumptions that can

remarks that the description of the coordinate axes (“Ox

and Owasin dimensions. O7 ve a)” a amb’s book Me-

armchair with his feet up! Then, after asking how his reader

side of its tangent, he states that there are four main schools
(to left or right of vertical tangent, or above or below hori-
zontal one) and that by lecturing without a figure, presum-
ing that the curve was to the nght of its vertical tangent, he
had unwittingly made nonsense for the other three schools.

I know of no better remedy for such presumptions than
Polya’s counsel: before trying to solve a problem, the stu-

dent should demonstrate his or her understanding of its

often the hardest part of researching a problem is under-
standing precisely what that problem says. They often fol-
low Polya’s wise advice: “If you can't solve a problem, then
there is an easier problem you can’t solve: find it.”

Readers who learn from this book will also want to learn
about its author’s life.!

For example, the meaning of the term HEURISTIC (set

on page 112. When the title of such an article is referred
to within the text it will be set in small capitals. Certain
paragraphs of a few articles are more technical; they are
enclosed in square brackets. Some articles are fairly
closely connected with the first part to which they add
further illustrations and more specific comments. Other
articles go somewhat beyond the aim of the first part of
which they explain the background. There is a key-
of the main articles and the plan underlying the Diction-

that there is a common plan and a certain unity, because
the articles of.the Dictionary show the greatest outward

2. Questions, recommendations, mental operations.
Trying to help the student effectively but unobtrusively
and naturally, the teacher is led to ask the same questions
and to indicate the same steps again and again. Thus, in
countless problems, we have to ask the question: What

1

—______g __________________]n the-Classroom—

is the unknown? We may vary the words, and ask the
same thing in many different ways: What is required?
What do you want to find? What are you supposed to
seek? The aim of these questions is to focus the student's
attention upon the unknown. Sometimes, we obtain the
unknown! Question and suggestion aim at the same
effect; they tend to provoke the same mental opera-
tion.

It seemed to the author that it might be worth while to
collect and to group questions and suggestions which are
The list we study contains questions and suggestions of
this sort, carefully chosen and arranged; they are equally

reader is sufficiently acquainted with the list and can see,
behind the suggestion, the action suggested, he may real-
ize that the list enumerates, indirectly, mental operations

operations are listed in the order in which they are most

retrospectively the question which was less advisable to
prove that the triangle with sides x, y, c is a right tri-

analogous to our proposed problem and, having solved
it, we have a model to follow.

In solving the analogous problem which we use now as
fibers parallel to one of its sides, AB. Now, we conceive
the tetrahedron ABCD as consisting of fibers parallel to
one of its edges, AB.

The midpoints of the fibers which constitute the tri-
angle lie all on the same straight line, a median of the

opposite vertex C. The midpoints of the fibers which con-

gravity of the tetrahedron. Therefore, these six median
planes must meet in one point which is precisely the
_____cemterof gravity.

gravity of the homogeneous tetrahedron. Io complete

through each line of intersection one more median plane

there we are likely to stumble again if the circumstances

3. Let us discuss a few points about the actual drawing

(I) Shall we draw the figures exactly or approxi-
figures have, in principle, the same role in geometry as
figures are less important than exact measurements be-
cause the theorems of geometry are much more exten-

more advanced. Yet, for the purpose of reasoning, care-
fully drawn free-hand figures are usually good enough,

and they are much more quickly done. Of course, the |

straight should not be wavy, and so-called circles should
not look like potatoes.

An inaccurate figure can occasionally suggest a false
conclusion, but the danger is not great and we can pro-
tect ourselves from it by various means, especially by

upon the logical connections and realize that the figure
is a help, but by no means the basis of our conclusions;
the logical connections constitute the real basis. [This
point is instructively illustrated by certain well known
paradoxes which exploit cleverly the intentional inac-

_______curacy_ of the figure.]
(II) It is important that the elements are assembled
in the required relations, it is unimportant in which
order they are constructed. Therefore, choose the most
convenient order. For example, to illustrate the idea of
trisection, you wish to draw two angles, a and 8, so that
a = 38. Starting from an arbitrary a, you cannot con-
struct @ with ruler and compasses. ‘Therefore, you choose
a fairly small, but otherwise arbitrary 8 and, starting

cialization. The different parts of the figure should not

lar, when they are not necessarily so. Triangles should
not seem to be isosceles, or right-angled, when no such

“A straight line and a solid with a center of symmetry

the given line and bisects the volume of the given solid.”

neglect what such older writers as Pappus, Descartes,
Leibnitz, and Bolzano have to say about the subject, but
it should least neglect unbiased experience. Experience in
solving problems and experience in watching other peo-

_________ Problems to find, problems to prove. We draw a paral-
lel between these two kinds of problems.
1. The aim of a “problem to find” 1s to find a certain
object, the unknown of the problem.
The unknown is also called ‘“‘quaesitum,” or the thing
sought, or the thing required. ‘Problems to find” may be

If we have to construct a triangle with sides a, b, c, the
unknown is a triangle, the data are the three lengths a,

that its sides have the given lengths a, b, c. If we have to

or for other reasons. Yet even in such cases proofs may
be desirable.

Proofs yield evidence; in so doing, they hold together
the logical system; and they help us to remember the
above, in connection with Fig. 23. This figure renders
evident the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle
equals 180°. The figure connects this fact with the other
fact that alternate angles are equal. Connected facts how-
ever are more interesting and are better retained than

Isolated facts. Thus, our figure fixes the two connected
geometric propositions in our mind and, finally, the
figure and the propositions may become our inalienable

there are cases in which it is scarcely possible to do so;
an important case is the teaching of the differential and

worse. It is painful when the author of a textbook pre-

they are used in their proper place and in good taste.

Their purpose is not to replace complete proofs, which

they never could, but to lend interest and coherence to
the presentation.

The role and interest of incomplete proofs is explained
to a certain extent by our study of the process of the solu-
